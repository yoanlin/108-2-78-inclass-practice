## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
n<- 540

conditionExpression_outcome=
  ifelse(n %% 2==0, "even", "odd") 

switch(
  conditionExpression_outcome,
  "even"={fvalue <- n/2},
  "odd"=fvalue <- -(n+1)/2, 
  warning("n要整數喔")  
)

print(fvalue)
```
